### Xephon-K

A time series database with multiple backends, the first one is based on Cassandra, CMPS278,
the second one is very similar to InfluxDB's TSM, it should be called [Xephon-S](https://github.com/xephonhq/xephon-s),
but due to package management, both Xephon-B and Xephon-S end up in Xephon-K
