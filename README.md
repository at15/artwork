- I spent most of my weekends in primary school with my teacher 牛犇 on drawing, where I learned sketch and water painting, some oil painting as well.
- Back in Shanghai Jiao Tong University, I had a minor major in animation, the faculty members are really nice, especially teacher Wu, though I never really finished my undergrad thesis for animation.
